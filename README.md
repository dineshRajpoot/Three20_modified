================

It was cloned from original three20. As there is no active development  is happening in the main project, we(iOS app dev team at private organization) thought to create a separate repo and contribute to it by making changes as required. It is still an open source project and will remain forever. We have fixed two issues which still exist in the main library..1. Double return on TTTextEdior  on first return press...2. TTTextEditor not returning on return key pressed on iOS6
